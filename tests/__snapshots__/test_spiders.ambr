      'article_text': 'The brutal winter of discretionary spend cuts in the IT industry is likely over, but there is little evidence of a recovery in the flow business. Hence, we are on track for one of the weakest first quarters for at least 10 years. We expect the revenues of IT services companies to recover following a tepid 4QFY24 for the industry, as the ramp-up of large cost-takeout deals could drive growth for large-caps in a seasonally strong quarter. The situation, though slightly better, is eerily similar to what we witnessed in 1HFY24. We would be looking for signs of recovery in discretionary spending in the form of deal activities , which have been heavily skewed towards cost-takeout projects. However, any disappointment in 1QFY25 could again put pressure on 2Q. We believe mid-tier companies could continue to perform well, especially those with strong offerings in “pre-GenAI” spending, such as data engineering . We expect aggregate revenue/EBIT/PAT to grow by 3.2/5.2/6.1% respectively (all in INR terms) yoy for our coverage universe. Verticals such as BFS and Communications have been under pressure for the past 5-6 quarters; and while spending patterns remain largely unchanged, deal wins over the past couple of quarters should start accelerating in this quarter. This should offer some respite to growth rates for these verticals, especially for Infosys as the base becomes more favorable. Hi-tech, following a brief recovery, might face challenges, as spending on software moderates. We expect no changes in guidance/commentary from companies on FY25 revenue growth . The focus of the commentaries is likely to remain on demand pick-up in 2HFY25, indicating a more normalized FY26 spending environment. We expect revenue growth of Tier-I companies to be in the range of -0.5% to +2.0% QoQ in CC. Revenue of Tier-II players is expected to grow by -1.5% to +5.0% QoQ in CC terms. The near-term macro uncertainties and no meaningful sign of recovery in discretionary IT spending are key concerns for large-cap names; however, we expect mid-tier players to continue their outperformance. Margins for the sector are likely to remain largely range-bound. The benefits from deferring wage hikes and benign currency movements could be offset by the ongoing challenge of recovering lost volumes. The first quarter is also anticipated to be affected by visa costs, leading to a slightly negative bias for the quarter. We believe FY25 will be a year of restrained wage hikes across the industry. Moreover, given the gradual nature of demand recovery, companies can adopt a more cautious approach towards their hiring strategies. This should lead to better margin defense for the sector. Given its size, order book and exposure to long-duration orders and portfolio, TCS is well positioned to withstand the weakening macro environment and ride on the anticipated industry growth. Owing to its steadfast market leadership position and best-in-class execution, the company has been able to maintain its industry-leading margin and demonstrate superior return ratios. The pent-up demand in BFSI should drive growth over the near and medium term. Among Tier-II players, Cyient is poised for robust performance. This will be supported by the revival in the aerospace vertical, the moderating challenges in sectors such as railways and communications, and a strong portfolio in its sustainability business. Additionally, the macro recovery should contribute incrementally to its overall growth in FY25E/FY26E.',

Credit growth to industry accelerated to 6.5 per cent in February 2022 from 1 per cent in February last year, which included growth acceleration to 71.4 per cent growth in the medium enterprises segment as against 30.6 per cent in the year-ago period. However, demand from large corporates continued to be sluggish with a growth of 0.5 per cent in February 2022, as against a de-growth of 0.6 per cent in the year-ago period. There have been concerns about the lack of capital investments due to lower capacity utilisation and large corporates have opted to de-leverage with the easy liquidity conditions. In the services sector, the overall credit growth slowed down to 5.6 per cent in February 2022 as against 8.8 per cent in the year-ago period. Shipping registered an 11.1 per cent de-growth as against a growth of 30 per cent in the year-ago period, the aviation industry reported a 12.9 per cent versus 35.1 per cent growth. Demand for credit from the financial services firms also seemed to be strong with overall NBFCs showing a 14.6 per cent growth which included housing finance companies (22.8 per cent) and public finance institutions (47.6 per cent), central bank data said. The central bank said credit to agriculture and allied activities continued to perform well, registering a growth of 10.4 per cent in the month as compared to 8.6 per cent in February 2021. On the retail side, the overall personal loans segment showed a 12.3 per cent increase in growth as against 9.6 per cent in the year-ago period, which included the demand for consumer durable continuing to be strong. Gold loan growth came down to 26.2 per cent against 75.9 per cent in February 2021, while the education segment continued to show a de-growth of 2.2 per cent probably driven by foreign travel being affected. Meanwhile, data on scheduled commercial banks' outstanding credit till December showed a rise at 8.1 per cent for the October-December period, making it the third consecutive quarter of rising. Private sector lenders led with a 13.4 per cent growth and accounted for 43 per cent of the incremental loans, the RBI said. After contracting for six successive quarters, annual growth in bank credit to the industrial sector turned positive in December 2021; the personal loan segment continued to grow at a robust pace and its share in total credit increased to 27.6 per cent from 25.6 per cent a year ago, the data showed.",

In the past one month, the stock of telecom service provider for Indian Railways has rallied 47 per cent after winning multiple orders worth Rs 161 crore. In the past one year, the stock price of RailTel has zoomed 342 per cent, as compared to 23 per cent rise in the BSE Sensex. At 01:21 pm; RailTel was trading 16 per cent higher at Rs 603, as against 1 per cent gain on the BSE benchmark index. The average trading volumes at the counter nearly doubled. A combined 58.18 million shares changed hands on the NSE and BSE. Railte is a Miniratna (category-I) PSU, which owns a pan-India fibre optic network, providing broadband and multimedia services, along with modernisation and maintenance of the communications network of the Indian Railways. The company now also offers services to other private and government clients as well. It has two main lines of business - telecom and projects. Under telecom services, it provides lease line services NLD, internet services (ISP) and passive infrastructure services (IP-1). Under the project segment, the company gains from its expertise to lay and maintain OFC networks for other entities. The company owns ~61,000 km of optical fibre network to provide long-distance services, including internet and passive infrastructure services, across the country. In addition, it executed critical projects of national importance such as BharatNet, National Knowledge Network (NKN), railway signalling, among others. The government of India is focused on improving the railway infrastructure and ensuring faster development and completion of tracks, rail electrification, rolling stock manufacturing and delivery of passenger freight services. The budgetary allocation towards railway projects has been increased to Rs 2.55 trillion for 2024-25 from Rs 2.40 trillion in the previous year. For fiscal 2024 (FY24), the company had posted a healthy 30.8 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in profit after tax at Rs 246.21 crore. Revenue from operations grew 31 per cent YoY at Rs 2,568 crore. Analysts expect RailTel to continue demonstrating healthy growth in operating income, aided by its robust order book position. Despite the Indian Railways’ policy shift towards open tenders involving private parties, the company’s order procurement remains healthy as the company enjoys a favourable position in the market, with a well-established network infrastructure and a strong presence in the railway business, according to ICRA.',

      'article_text': "The division bench of Delhi High Court on Thursday refused to stay its single-judge order upholding an arbitral award asking SpiceJet and its promoter Ajay Singh to pay Sun Group Chairman Kalanithi Maran an amount of Rs 270 crore plus interest. The court asked them to pay Rs 100 crore by September 10 to prove bona fide, subject to their rights and contentions. On Wednesday, SpiceJet and its CMD moved the High Court challenging a single judge's order directing them to refund over Rs 270 crore to Maran and Kal Airways. Besides, they sought to waive the 12 per cent interest on warrants and set aside the 18 per cent interest granted in the award. The next date of hearing is on September 11. Kal Airways and Maran also requested to invalidate the portion of the award that included interest on the amount of Rs 270 crore for the non-issuance of compulsory redeemable preference shares. Both requests were rejected. The HC on Thursday while issuing notice to airlines said that it is bound by the Supreme Court’s February order that asked the carrier to pay Rs 75 crore within 3 months. SpiceJet’s lawyers submitted before the court that they would pay Rs 75 crore immediately and that the airline employs 10,000 people but the bench denied any relief. While the application for stay stands rejected by the division bench, the main appeal will be heard on October 31. Earlier, Maran’s counsel had argued that SpiceJet and Singh filed their affidavit in a 'sealed cover' and in a format not mandated by law. Maran’s lawyer claimed that the company's liability to Maran now is over Rs 395 crore. On July 31, the Delhi HC upheld the validity of the arbitral award against SpiceJet. Shares of were trading at Rs 31.70, up by 0.09 per cent, at 2 PM. The tiff between Maran and SpiceJet goes back to 2015 when CMD Singh, who used to own SpiceJet before Maran, bought it back from him. Maran had transferred his 58.46 per cent stake in the airline to Singh for just Rs 2 in 2015. However, as per the deal, Maran was supposed to get redeemable warrants in return for the money invested by him during his tenure as a promoter of the airline. Maran was liable to get Rs 18 crore warrants, which is about 26 per cent stake in SpiceJet. But Maran did not get his share of the money, neither convertible warrants nor preference shares. Maran then claimed that suffered damages of over Rs 1,300 crore. Thereafter, Maran approached the Delhi High Court, which referred the matter to arbitration.",

      'article_text': 'HDFC Bank shares on Friday fell sharply after the private lender posted a quarter-on-quarter (Q0Q) decline in loans disbursed in the first quarter of the ongoing financial year (2024-25). The stock slipped 4.55 per cent to settle at Rs 1,648.10. At this price, it has fallen 8.03 per cent from its 52-week high of Rs 1,791.90, a level seen a couple of sessions earlier on July 3. In the April-June quarter (Q1 FY25), gross advances dipped 0.8 per cent sequentially to 24.87 lakh crore. The drop in loan growth was due to a 5 per cent QoQ decline in corporate loans. The bank\'s deposits stood at Rs 23.79 lakh crore in the June quarter, nearly flat from the previous quarter. Low-cost current and savings account deposits fell 5 per cent, sequentially, to Rs 8.64 lakh crore in the quarter. Loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR), a metric to assess whether a lender has enough deposits to fund loan growth, was flat at 105 per cent compared with the prior quarter. These are provisional figures and the bank is scheduled to announce its financial results on July 20. Looking at the lender\'s business update, we\'ve maintained a stance that numbers are only going to improve gradually, Mayuresh Joshi, Head-Equity Research at William O\'Neil India, told . "The stock has moved significantly in the last few months. So, investors can look at it at lower levels. The stock will go through a phase of consolidation till numbers show improvement. And, the figures will start showing some element of respite by the second half of this financial year," Joshi stated. On technical setup, a few analysts said support on the counter could be seen at Rs 1,590 and resistance may be found at Rs 1,700. With that being said, one of them suggested booking profit in the current Rs 1,630-1,660 zone. "The stock has near-term support at Rs 1,590 level. It is expected to recover once a stability is confirmed near the Rs 1,590 zone and thereafter regain strength to carry on with the upward move. A decisive breach below Rs 1,530 would weaken the overall trend," said Shiju Koothupalakkal, Technical Research Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher. "HDFC Bank\'s stock has encountered strong resistance around Rs 1,700 level. We advise traders to avoid initiating fresh positions at current market price," said Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Technical Research Analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

      'article_text': 'Paramount Global will continue reducing the size of its workforce until its merger with Skydance Media closes, the company\'s co-CEOs said in a memo seen by Reuters on Sunday, hours after the companies announced the deal. NSE Paramount will also look to divest some of its assets, co-CEOs Brian Robbins, George Cheeks and Chris McCarthy said in the memo. "Until the transaction closes, it\'s business as usual—we will continue to operate as an independent company and move forward with the strategic plan we outlined at our town hall," they said. In June, Paramount said it would focus on its new plan to transform its streaming business, reduce costs and divest some assets to help pay down debt. Shari Redstone, Paramount\'s non-executive chair, will sell the family\'s controlling stake in the company in the merger. The entertainment giant Paramount will merge with Skydance, closing out a decades-long run by the Redstone family in Hollywood and injecting desperately needed cash into a legacy studio that has struggled to adapt to a shifting entertainment landscape. It also signals the rise of a new power player, David Ellison, the founder of Skydance and son of billionaire Larry Ellison, the founder of the software company Oracle. The new combined company is valued at around $28 billion. In connection with the proposed transaction, which is expected to close in September 2025 pending regulatory approval, a consortium led by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital will be investing $8 billion. Skydance, based in Santa Monica, California, has helped produce some major Paramount hits in recent years, including Tom Cruise films like “Top Gun: Maverick” and installments of the “Mission Impossible” series. Skydance was founded in 2010 by David Ellison and it quickly formed a production partnership with Paramount that same year. If the deal is approved, Ellison will become chairman and chief executive officer of what\'s being called New Paramount. Paramount is one of Hollywood\'s oldest studios, dating back its founding in 1914 as a distributor. Throughout its rich history, Paramount has had a hand in releasing films – from “Sunset Boulevard" and “The Godfather," to “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “Titanic”. The studio also distributed several early Marvel Cinematic Universe films, including “Iron Man" and "Thor,” before the Disney acquisition. In addition to “Mission: Impossible” and “Top Gun,” Paramount\'s current franchises include “Transformers,” “Star Trek” and “Jackass.” While Paramount has not topped the annual domestic box office charts for over a decade, the wild box office success of “Top Gun: Maverick” in 2022 (nearly $1.5 billion worldwide) was an important boon to both movie theatres and the industry\'s pandemic recovery. Still, its theatrical output has declined somewhat in recent years. Last year it released only eight new movies and came in fifth place for overall box office at around $2 billion – behind Universal (24 films), Disney (17 films), Warner Bros. and Sony. This year the release calendar is similarly modest, especially with the absence of “Mission: Impossible 8,” which was pushed to 2025 amid the strikes. They\'ve had some successes, with “Bob Marley: One Love” and “A Quiet Place: Day One,” and still to come is Ridley Scott\'s “Gladiator” sequel. Late last year, Warner Bros. Discovery also made headlines for exploring a potential merger with Paramount. But by February, Warner had reportedly halted those talks. Reuters and AP contributed to this article',

This kind of job creation doesn’t sqaure with the poor consumption growth of just 4% that the GDP data shows for FY24. What is more bizarre, the data set shows that about 42 million jobs were created in FY20 and 31 million in FY21, though both were COVID years and resulted in huge job losses as restaurants and travel industry shut down completely. Even more surprising, the total jobs in the economy hover between 471 million and 473 million for 6 years between FY12 to FY17 and then start climbing during COVID years starting FY20. Economists who specialise in labour studies say the PLFS data also shows a rise in worker population ratio since COVID, but these are largely self employed and own-family work. Regular wage employment has actually declined since COVID, they said.

      'article_text': 'FMCG major Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) on Monday (July 8) said it reported a mixed performance across its global operations. Despite challenging operating conditions in India, the company\'s domestic business showed resilience, achieving high-single-digit organic volume growth and mid-single-digit value growth. NSE "Reported growth for India will be in double digits for volume and high-single digits for value , with broad-based contributions from both the Home Care and Personal Care segments," the company said. Demand for household insecticides was initially soft due to extreme heatwaves across the country. However, GCPL\'s Park Avenue and KamaSutra brands have performed well following portfolio simplification actions, aligning with the company\'s full-year growth ambitions. Also Read: Pitti Engineering launches ₹360-crore QIP, issue price at ₹1,054.25 per share The Indonesian business continued its strong performance, recording high-single-digit volume growth and double-digit constant currency sales growth. However, the significant depreciation of the Indonesian currency led to lower growth in INR terms. In the GAUM (Godrej Africa, USA, and Middle East) region, the organic business is expected to see a double-digit volume decline, primarily driven by a high base in Q1 FY24 due to the appointment of a National Distributor, which provided a one-time sell-in benefit. Additionally, difficult pricing decisions in Nigeria and supply disruptions in South Africa, caused by a shipping crisis, further impacted performance. The ongoing currency devaluation in Nigeria continued to negatively affect INR sales. Despite these challenges, GCPL achieved strong double-digit EBITDA growth in INR terms.

      'article_text': 'The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced on Monday mandatory inspections for 2,600 Boeing 737 airplanes due to concerns over potential failures of passenger oxygen masks in emergency situations. This directive covers both 737 MAX and NG models following instances where oxygen generators in passenger service units were found to be dislodged, posing risks of inadequate oxygen supply during a loss of cabin pressure. Inspections will involve comprehensive visual checks, with affected oxygen generators replaced as needed with new or serviceable units. Thermal pads will also be secured and generators repositioned to ensure compliance with safety standards. Boeing issued a bulletin on June 17 advising airlines to conduct visual inspections, prompting the FAA’s airworthiness directive to take immediate effect. Airlines must complete inspections and necessary corrective actions within 120 to 150 days, contingent on the specific 737 model. Furthermore, the FAA prohibits the installation of potentially faulty components. Boeing has not yet responded to requests for comment on the FAA’s directive.',

      'article_text': 'On Tuesday, Nifty 50 hit a new all-time high of 24,429.15 indicating that the markets are in a strong bullish trend. However, the very next trading session saw Nifty giving up 1.2% gains intra-day. India’s biggest yearly event Budget is on July 23 and there is a lot of volatility surrounding it in the market. One basic question is how do you play the markets? Should you book profit or be a fence sitter now? Here are some key levels to watch out for and an analysis of the trend so far: According to experts, if settles above the mark of 24,400 then it is expected to move towards 24,600 and 24,800 even before the Budget. However, a strong resistance will follow at the mark of 25,000. With a similar approach, Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President of Research at Religare Broking said that a positive trend may continue until Nifty breaks the 23800 level, any upmove above 24,500 can take Nifty to a new milestone i.e. 25000. However, on the downside, if the index falls below 24,000, it could correct to 23,600 and 23,400, said Mandar Bhojane Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking. Giving an extreme scenario, Anand James, Chief Strategist at said that Nifty and Sensex have room for upside till 24720/860 and 80860/81650 respectively with the present move, while their downside marker may be placed at 21160/79890, respectively. “For Sensex, the immediate hurdle is placed at 80,400. If Sensex closes decisively above this level on a daily scale, the next targets are 81,800–82,000. Support for Sensex is at 79,000, with 78,400 (21 DEMA) being the next support level if breached,” said Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager and Technical Research Analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. The RSI is at 73.60, indicating that the current bullish trend is likely to continue ahead. According to Bhojane, it suggests that a further 1-2% rally is possible until the budget. Post- , Nifty has gained around 3,119 points (14.6%). However, cautioning investors Mishra of Religare said that the indicators are showing slightly overbought positions which is causing time-wise correction in the indices. Most technical indicators are pointing towards a bullish trajectory. The Nifty50 and the Sensex are trading above their short-term moving averages, specifically the 10-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs). Additionally, the MACD indicator is also displaying a positive trajectory, said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, Assistant Vice President of Research and Advisory at Master Capital Services. Also, the FIIs’ long-short ratio in index futures has surged to 84%, the highest in months, indicating a heavy leaning towards bullish positions and potential for significant profit booking. “Traders are advised to close their short-term and long positions to capitalize on these gains,” said Patel. This time, markets are approaching the budget with VIX near the 30-day low, a 57% decline from the peak volatility seen after the election result announcement. While the low VIX points towards a low volatility expectation, the risk is always on the upside for the VIX, which is further amplified by cues from the US expected shortly by way of inflation figures, Powell’s testimony etc. As is, Nifty’s range expectation, as projected by VIX is 25340-23440 for the next 30 days, which might widen by another percentage in the run-up to budget day, said James. “To defend against volatility, a strategy of buying on dips at 23,700 and 23,600 is recommended if the index drops below 24,000,” Bhojane added. Investors can rely on the same old method, focusing towards defensive sectors like and pharma can provide stability in a highly volatile market. With a different approach, Patel of Anand Rathi suggests that if the index surpasses 24,500, the rally could extend to higher levels. However, it is prudent to book full profits in this scenario to mitigate the risks associated with the current bullish extremities in the market. Over the years, the budget has ceased to be a day for knee-jerk reactions. Nevertheless, the run-up to the budget day is prone to episodes of some knee-jerk reactions, as markets cannot remain unaffected by speculations.',

      'article_text': 'Credit/debit card charges are levied by the banks on their customers based on the type of card opted for and number of transactions. However, you might have noticed that State Bank of India (SBI) has debited Rs 147.5 from your bank account without you making any transaction. This amount has been deducted from your account under the annual maintenance/service fee for the debit/ATM card used by you. The SBI provides a host of debit cards to its customers and most of them are Classic/Silver/ Contactless/Global debit cards. An amount of Rs 125 is charged by the bank as an annual maintenance fee for these cards. While the charge is Rs 125, SBI deducted Rs 147.5 from your account because a Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 18 per cent is applied on this service fee. Hence, 18 per cent of Rs 125 amounts to Rs 22.5. So, Rs 22.5 is added to Rs 125, resulting in Rs 147.5. Additionally, if you wish to replace or change your debit card, then the bank will levy Rs 300+GST for this service, apart from the service charge. Several types of debit cards are offered by SBI like domestic, international, and co-branded cards. You can apply for a SBI debit card on the basis of your spending requirements. All the debit cards offered by SBI are linked to your bank account, and when you do a transaction via your debit card, the money is deducted directly from your bank account. It’s not just the SBI which charges an annual maintenance fee for the debit/ATM card. Other banks also deduct an annual service fee from their customers’ account. For instance, ICICI Bank charges a joining fee of Rs 499 and an annual charge of the same amount for Coral debit cards. This fee is not charged by the bank for other debit cards. Moreover, ICICI Bank charges Rs 25 for the regeneration of a debit card PIN. This fee is not applied on the requests made via “instapin” at its branches or via customer care using IVR. ICICI Bank debit card holders are charged Rs 25 per transaction for any transaction decline at other bank ATMs or points of sale (PoS) because of insufficient balance in the account.

Policymakers voted unanimously to maintain the US central bank\'s benchmark interest rate between 5.25 percent and 5.50 percent, the Fed announced in a statement following two days of deliberations. After a small uptick in inflation earlier this year, recent data suggest that the Fed\'s mission of bringing inflation back down to its long-term target of two percent is now firmly back on track. Its favoured measure of inflation eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent last month, while economic growth has remained resilient, and the labour market has come into better balance. "In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee\'s 2 percent inflation objective," the Fed said. This marks a slight change in tone from its decision in June, when it noted only that "modest further progress" had been made. "The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance," the Fed said, adding that it was "attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate." Fed Chair Jerome Powell will address reporters later Wednesday, and analysts expect him to hint at the possibility of an interest rate cut at the next Fed meeting in September.',

      'article_text': '(Bloomberg) -- Ahead of his first G-20 summit, Donald Trump took to Twitter to weigh in on his concerns. From bad trade deals (“the worst’’) to North Korea’s nuclear ambitions (“this nonsense’’) to steel dumping (“don’t like’’), Trump highlighted what he’d hit head-on in Hamburg. The problem for the U.S. president: he comes home from the Group-of-20 summit with little concrete progress on those issues, while the differences between himself and the rest of the world are greater than ever. Trump got lectured on trade by China and France and won platitudes from other nations -- but no evident progress -- on North Korea. The starkest difference was on climate: the G-20’s final statement called the 2015 Paris accord “irreversible.” Trump the pact last month. In his first sit-down with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Trump’s twin concerns, Iran and Ukraine, were barely touched upon as the two agreed on a Syrian cease-fire, details to come. On North Korea, meetings between Trump and the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China ended without a clear consensus about how to curb North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. The words “North Korea” are not in the final communique. This leaves Trump, weakened at home by the swirling congressional and FBI probes into his campaign, in danger of being undermined abroad as well, with a limited ability to rally world leaders to his most important causes, experts said. “A big message of it is this 19-versus-one frame,’’ said , director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “They are quite isolated.’’ Trump didn’t go home totally empty-handed, though, and his team seemed when briefing reporters on Air Force One on the return flight. He did seem to be getting the peculiar art of global summitry down on this trip -- less scowling, more back-slapping -- and some foreign delegations said Trump’s team was more engaged in the work of crafting a final statement, even if the outcome put stark differences on display. “The was a wonderful success and carried out beautifully by Chancellor Angela Merkel,” Trump tweeted from Air Force One on the ride home. Linking Trump’s earlier stop in Poland to the G-20, national security adviser H.R. McMaster said the trip represented “a recognition by us, one, that America First doesn’t mean the rest of the world last, or America First doesn’t mean America alone, and it means peace, prosperity and the rule of law.” In Poland, the president “gave a stirring affirmation of our values and why it’s important for us to understand who we are and be determined to protect our values,” he said. Trump’s Warsaw speech raised eyebrows by stifling government bureaucracies with terrorism as threats to western civilization. And top economic adviser Gary Cohn said that even talks on climate -- one of the sharpest area differences between Trump and other leaders -- were “not a situation where there was contentious discussion.” Trump also reserved his right to impose as a way to fight back against other nations, including China, dumping too much steel into the marketplace. In summit parlance, the G-20 recognized the right of countries to use “limited trade defense instruments” -- also known as tariffs. Language about a “level playing field” and “reciprocal” trade in the final communique also could have come straight from Trump. Trump’s most significant achievement at the G-20 came during a two-plus-hour meeting with Putin, where the two leaders struck an agreement for a cease-fire in part of Syria -- “a major, major success,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. But even that meeting yielded controversy, with both sides offering competing narratives about how much Trump pressured Putin on suspected Russian meddling in the U.S. election last year. “I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it.” Trump said in a tweet. “Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia.” Trump added that “he negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria,” and discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit with Putin. Among the many bilats, trilats and pull-asides, one thing Trump didn’t do was to take questions from the traveling news media, as is typical of U.S. presidents at the G-20, or to give formal remarks at the end of the meeting. Trump also a news conference on his week-long trip in May to Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Vatican, Belgium, and Italy. The president largely avoided the cringe-worthy moments that marked May’s G-7 outing and trip to the Middle East, though social media exploded over a photo of his daughter, Ivanka Trump, sitting in his seat at the G-20 table, China’s Xi Jinping and Britain’s Theresa May. Trump’s friendlier personal approach, despite significant policy differences, could pay off for him in the future, said Judy Dempsey, a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe, part of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Memories are short. These multilateral meetings are huge,’’ she said. “You can do fantastic networking.’’ On trade, Trump also found himself the target of thinly veiled barbs from other world leaders voicing concern about the protectionist policies that he has embraced -- including from Xi, who accused “developed nations” of engaging in unfair trade practices. During a working lunch on trade, Trump told the gathered world leaders that he would always defend the American worker, according to a western diplomatic official familiar with the closed-door session. French President Emmanuel Macron challenged Trump’s view that the U.S. is losing out on trade, telling the U.S. president that it doesn’t make sense to talk about bilateral trade balances in a multilateral world, the official said. Brandishing an Apple iPhone, which is designed in the U.S., assembled in China and sold around the world, Macron told reporters Saturday that it’s a “profound mistake’’ to judge the benefits of trade through the prism of deficits or surpluses -- something Trump does regularly. It is trade where Trump’s relations with world leaders are mostly likely to further deteriorate, and most dramatically, especially if the U.S. goes forward with a proposal for tariffs, quotas or a combination of both on steel imports, citing national security grounds. A decision could come any time -- and that would mean any goodwill from Hamburg would be shattered, said Wright of Brookings. “All of this will be for naught, if in a week’s time he imposes these steel tariffs,’’ he said. --With assistance from Margaret Talev and Adveith Nair To contact the reporters on this story: Toluse Olorunnipa in Washington at tolorunnipa@bloomberg.net, Nick Wadhams in Washington at nwadhams@bloomberg.net.

Blackstone is eying to buy stakes at a valuation of up to Rs 70,000 crore as per the moneycontrol\'s report. Blackstone Inc is an American multinational private equity company. Blackstone along with consortium partners Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Singapore\'s GIC are currently in discussions with the Agrawal family which runs the Haldiram business. However, in the past the negotiations were discontinued due to disagreements regarding the valuation of the business. Reportedly, the talks have resumed between Haldiram\'s promoters and Blackstone, again in the past few weeks. "There has been a lot of back and forth with the family members over the valuation of the business. Also, the family is not looking at giving away a 76 per cent controlling stake, which the private equity investors wanted, and want to retain a larger share of the business. Some family members would like to sell only a 51 per cent stake but the current discussions with Blackstone are likely to see a stake sale of closer to 74 per cent," a source in the report said. Haldiram had its humble beginning in 1918, it started from a small sweet shop in Bikaner, today it is an international snack giant. There\'s hardly anyone in India who is unaware of the brand called Haldiram. The brand has over the years expanded its products range. It\'s popularity isn\'t just limited to India but Haldiram\'s sweets and snacks have found its fans in foreign countries which has helped in expanding its market, globally. If the deal is sealed, it will be the biggest private equity buyout in India till date, the report said.',

      'article_text': 'Cochin Shipyard once again hit a new high at Rs 2,924 on Friday, up by nearly 7.5 per cent. Interestingly, the rally witnessed in the multibagger defence stock comes at a time when the broader market was experiencing a correction after consecutive bull run. While BSE Sensex surpassed the 80k psychological level, NSE nifty touched the 24,400 mark. On a year-to-date basis, Cochin Shipyard has delivered a robust 316 per cent return on the National Stock Exchange. Despite these massive gains, the stock\'s lofty PE ratio of 95—the highest in the industry—raises eyebrows, especially when compared to peers like Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders and Garden Reach. Industry-wise, the overall outlook of defence sector seems buoyed by positive winds, as the shipping ministry is set to launch a new shipbuilding and repair policy under the 100-day action plan of Maritime India Vision 2030, according to a PTI report. As Cochin Shipyard continues to break records in the green territory, investors are left pondering the looming question, how much is too much for this soaring stock? The company saw a 61 per cent surge in its consolidated revenue figure from Rs 2571.57 crore in FY23 to Rs 4140.63 crore in FY24, as per their investor presentation. Whereas, PAT (Profit after tax) stood at Rs 1070.94 crore, up by nearly 155 per cent from Rs 418.44 recorded in FY23. Notably, the company was able to decrease its net debt massively from Rs 132 crore to just Rs 23 crore in the last financial year. As per a report by ICICI Direct, the ship manufacturer also has a strong pipeline in both defence and commercial shipbuilding space, including repair and exports. Around Rs 9,000 crore worth of shipbuilding contracts are expected to be tendered in the medium term, with an additional Rs 84,000 crore in the request for proposal (RFP) stage. In the defence segment, the Indian Navy\'s future warship procurement plans present massive opportunities for Cochin Shipyard, including a potential Rs 40,000 crore order for another aircraft carrier. The defence sector has altogether witnessed a bull run. While Mazagon Dock has seen a staggering 146 per cent surge year-to-date, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers have delivered a strong 209 per cent return on the National Stock Exchange. However, despite their robust market caps many defence companies have lower free-float, which could impact liquidity. In a recent announcement, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh highlighted India’s unprecedented growth in defence production. "India has registered the highest ever growth in the value of defence production in 2023-24. The value of production has reached to Rs. 1,26,887 crore in 2023-24 which is 16.8 per cent higher than the value of production of previous financial year," Singh said in a social media post. The Make in India programme is crossing new milestones, year after year, under the leadership of PM Shri . India has registered the highest ever growth in the value of defence production in 2023-24. The value of production has reached to Rs. 1,26,887 crore in… "The current valuation of Cochin Shipyard is high, indicating that the stock might be overvalued at present levels," Dr. Ravi Singh, SVP - Retail Research, Religare Broking Ltd said.',

      'article_text': 'Chinese authorities have banned the accounting firm PwC for six months and fined it over 400 million yuan ($56.4 million) over its involvement in the audit of collapsed property developer Evergrande. The punishment is the heaviest yet for international accounting firms operating in China. PwC will be banned from signing off on any financial results in the country for six months. Already, it has been losing clients. China\'s Ministry of Finance said in a statement on Friday (September 13, 2024) that it was imposing 116 million yuan ($16.35 million) in fines and confiscation of illegal gains on PwC Zhong Tian, also known as PwC China, as well as a six-month business suspension, revocation of PwC\'s Guangzhou branch and an administrative warning. A separate regulator, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, also imposed fines and confiscations totaling 325 million yuan ($45.8 million) on PwC for allegedly failing to perform due diligence in the audit of Evergrande. China\'s finance ministry said PwC issued "false audit reports" of Evergrande and that the audit procedures had “serious defects” in design and implementation, leading to many false conclusions. It also accused PwC of not maintaining “professional skepticism” and failing to point out errors and a lack of information disclosure by Evergrande during the audits. The securities regulator said 88% of the records kept by PwC regarding the real estate projects were inconsistent with the actual implementation and were “seriously unreliable.” When on-site investigations were carried out, some projects were still “a piece of vacant land” despite being considered to have met the delivery conditions, the regulator said. “The work performed by PwC Zhong Tian’s Hengda audit team fell well below our high expectations and was completely unacceptable,” Mohamed Kande, global chair of PwC, said in a statement on its website. Hengda is the principal subsidiary of China Evergrande Group. “It is not representative of what we stand for as a network and there is no room for this at PwC,” he said. The statement said PwC Zhong Tian has cooperated fully with regulators, respects their decisions and will fully comply with the administrative penalties. PwC China has fired six partners and five staff directly involved in the Hengda audit, it said. The firm is also in the process of issuing financial penalties for current and former firm leaders who were responsible for the business, the statement said. PwC came under Beijing’s scrutiny after the January collapse of Evergrande, the world’s most indebted developer and a symbol of China’s ongoing property crisis. China\'s securities regulator said in March that Evergrande had inflated its mainland China revenues by almost $80 billion in 2019 and 2020. In May, authorities fined the company $577 million. PwC had audited Evergrande’s accounts for 14 years until 2023 and gave it a clean bill of health. PwC has been the largest of the “big four” accounting firms operating in China, taking in nearly 8 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in revenues in 2022, above competitors Deloitte, KPMG and EY, according to the Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants. China has been cracking down on excessive borrowing by developers during a prolonged property market slump that has hit many other parts of the economy, including construction, building materials and home appliances.',

      'article_text': 'Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) chairperson , facing a host of allegations of conflict of interest, have rejected all allegations in a fresh statement issued on Friday (September 13, 2024) on their personal capacity. Issuing point by point rebuttal to all the specific allegations accompanied by statements issued by companies [clients of Mr. Buch] named by Congress and other reports, the couple insisted that “all the allegations made are false, incorrect, malicious and motivated.” “The allegations themselves are based on our Income Tax Returns. In other words, all these matters are a part of our income tax returns in which all these matters have been fully disclosed and taxes have been duly paid,” they said. “Shockingly, our income tax returns clearly have been obtained by adopting fraudulent means and illegally. This is a clear breach of not only our right to privacy (which is a fundamental right) but also a violation of the Income Tax Act,” they emphasised. They said the facts, transparently reflected in their income tax returns, had been twisted deliberately to create a false narrative. “Further, going by the pattern of creating a false narrative at periodic intervals, it appears that the allegations are being made in instalments, only to keep the pot boiling,” they said. Stating that if the objective had been to arrive at the truth rather than to malign individuals and institutions with distortions of facts, they said they wonder why all allegations would not be brought out, in public, at one go. “We would then have given all the facts at one go. If, however, this false narrative is motivated, to achieve some other objective, then the possibility of further allegations being made repeatedly in instalments in the future may not be ruled out,” they said. Stressing that they are upright and honest professionals and have led their respective professional lives with transparency and dignity, “earning an unblemished record”, they said though everyone can see a clear pattern emerging to distort and twist the facts, they are confident that they would be able to “demolish all such motivated allegations even in future, while reserving our right to take appropriate legal remedy as we may be advised.” “The fact that so far, allegations are being made with new falsehoods each time, in instalments, makes it clear that the only intention is to keep distorting facts, to keep making false allegations again and again to build a false narrative. Clearly, arriving at the truth is not the objective,” they said. On the rental income matter pertaining to a Wockhardt Ltd. subsidiary they said, “The property was leased out in the normal course. As it turned out subsequently, the lessee happened to be an associate of Wockhardt, a listed company which had come under investigation.” “Madhabi has not dealt with any files related to Wockhardt. Given the all-India remit of SEBI’s responsibilities, which encompass hundreds of investigations, thousands of surveillance alerts, hundreds of approvals, and hundreds of orders annually, the Chairperson is usually not even aware of specific cases, as they are handled in the normal course by other designated officials as per Delegation of Powers which have always been in place,” they said. “In this context, even an allegation of conflict is not only defamatory, false and vexatious, but is clearly malicious and motivated. SEBI operates under a clear and well-defined Delegation of Powers, ensuring that investigations are handled in accordance with established procedures,” they said in the statement. “For investigations, various powers are vested in senior officials such as Chief General Managers, Executive Directors, or Whole-Time Members. Accordingly, no investigation files go to the Chairperson,” they said. “It is highlighted that the rental agreement for the property in question was concluded in accordance with standard market practices and this property jointly owned by Madhabi and Dhaval is leased and the rental from the same is declared and tax paid accordingly,” they added. “A simple internet search and analysis would show that the rental income from the property was completely in line with market rates. The assertion that the rental rates were “off market” are patently false,” they further said.',

      'article_text': 'Dabur remains a top pick in the Consumer Goods sector for Emkay Global due to its diversified portfolio and strong execution. The company’s focus on rural growth remains firm, with distribution expansion showing robust progress. Dabur’s strategy of expanding the Total Addressable Market (TAM) across brands with well-supported category extensions through distribution and marketing continues to yield positive results. Emkay Global maintains a BUY rating on Dabur, with a target price of ₹700 per share by June 2025, based on a 46x P/E multiple. The brokerage expects Dabur to achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% in sales and 15 per cent in earnings over FY24-27. Dabur’s topline is expected to grow by 6%, with mid-single-digit volume growth in domestic operations. Gross margin is anticipated to expand by 90 basis points year-on-year (YoY) to 47.5 per cent. EBITDA expansion is expected to be limited to 20 basis points YoY, reaching 19.5%, due to increased spending on advertising and promotion (A&P), which is projected to rise by 18 per cent. DART has a slightly different take on Dabur’s performance. On a consolidated basis, DART assumes approximately 7% revenue growth, aligning with the company’s guidance. Margins are expected to improve YoY to 19.6 per cent. At the current market price, the stock is trading at 43x FY26E EPS. DART currently holds an “Accumulate” rating on Dabur. Both Emkay Global and DART highlight Dabur’s strong position in the Consumer Goods sector, with particular emphasis on rural growth and strategic category extensions. While Emkay Global projects robust long-term growth with a BUY rating, DART provides a more conservative outlook with an accumulate rating, acknowledging steady revenue growth and margin improvements.',

"We have no exposure to the Nirav Modi group of companies. We have not issued any Letter of Undertaking (LOU) nor do we have any buyer’s credit exposure against LOUs with respect to the Nirav Modi group of companies as well as the Gitanjali group of companies.

      'article_text': 'New Delhi/Mumbai: The CBI has written a mail to jeweller on his official email address asking him to join the investigation. Replying to the investigative agency, he said, "we have businesses abroad so I can\'t join the investigation." The CBI is reported to have again written to Nirav Modi to contact the High Commission of the concerned country and told him that the agency will arrange his travel. They have directed him to join investigation next week saying it was mandatory. Meanwhile, earlier, the diamond trader, a key accused in the alleged which is now pegged at close to USD 2 billion, faced more heat on Tuesday with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) moving a court for a non-bailable warrant (NBW) and another court issuing summons to him in a tax evasion case. As Nirav Modi\'s international jewellery business in the US, officials said the CBI questioned the CEO and the MD of Allahabad Bank Usha Ananthasubramanian in the Punjab National Bank fraud case that allegedly involved him and his uncle Mehul Choksi. Ananthasubramanian was the Managing Director and the CEO of PNB since August 14, 2015, before being appointed in Allahabad Bank on May 6, 2017. In Mumbai, Special PMLA Court Judge MS Azmi heard the arguments of ED\'s special counsel Hiten Venegoankar on Tuesday on the agency\'s plea seeking issuance of the NBW against Nirav Modi who is believed to be in the US. Venegoankar told the court the ED registered a case against Nirav Modi on February 15 and from that time issued three summonses to him to appear before the agency. He said the summonses were issued on February 15, February 17 and February 22, asking him to appear before the ED on February 16, February 22 and February 26, respectively. The ED lawyer said Nirav Modi did not appear before the agency for questioning and hence it has sought issuance of an NBW was against him. A local court in Mumbai issued summons against Nirav Modi in connection with an income tax evasion probe against him and his companies, officials said. They said the court of Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate issued the summons and asked Nirav Modi to appear before it on March 12. The court issued the notice after the Income Tax Department had last week filed a chargesheet against him for alleged evasion of taxes and the court took cognisance of it on Tuesday. The chargesheet was filed under sections 276 C (1) (wilful attempt to evade tax), 277 A (false statement in verification), 278 B (offences by companies) and 278 E (presumption as to culpable mental state) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. On questioning of Ananthasubramanian, a CBI official said in Delhi that agency wants to get clarifications from her as to how huge transactions were bypassing surveillance system in the PNB and whether audit reports were red flagging these transactions. The 60-year-old banker, who was recently elected as the chief of Indian Banks\' Association, had held senior positions in the PNB where Modi and Choksi were allegedly getting fraudulent guarantees since 2011. The PNB has said that the alleged fraud perpetrated by Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi may be around USD 2 billion, over USD 204 million more than previously estimated. In a late night filing to stock exchanges on Tuesday, the state-owned lender said that "the quantum of reported unauthorised transactions can increase by USD 204.25 million." The bank had earlier put the defrauded amount at Rs 11,394.02 crore (USD 1.77 billion). Adding another Rs 1,323 crore would take this to Rs 12,717 crore. (With PTI inputs)',

The Fed decision tonight and the interim Budget tomorrow will weigh on markets in the near-term, says V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. Global markets will be keenly watching the Fed comment on the timeline and quantum of rate cuts. The first rate cut is likely to come in June 2024. The decline in the 10-year yield to 4.02% is positive since it will restrain FPI outflows, he said. The domestic market will be focused on the interim Budget particularly on any proposals regarding taxation of investments relating to the capital market. The fiscal deficit and its glide path also is important since growth with stability is hugely important from the market perspective, he said. Stock specific movements are likely in response to sectoral allocations in the Budget, he added.",
